## Anthony Bryan A.

## Me

Hello, I am a student of Computer Engineering and a lifelong autodidact. Before starting my studies, I spent several years exploring web development, frameworks, and related technologies. This experience played a key role in my decision to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.

I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and lately, I have been using the Astro framework extensively for my freelance projects. Currently, I am independently improving my JavaScript skills and diving into the world of React.

Additionally, I am passionate about learning and working with other programming languages such as Python and Java. I am currently in my second year of the degree program and already have experience with Java, Python, SQL, and more.

## Goals

My main goal is to become a full stack developer. As a secondary goal, I would love to enter the field of data analysis and data science. Although it is quite a different area, I have gained autonomous experience in this field through courses and personal projects, and I would like to deepen my knowledge and continue exploring it further.

## Interests

There are several areas that I am passionate about and that motivate me to keep learning and growing professionally. One of these is working with efficient and versatile operating systems, which is why I currently use Linux. This environment allows me to develop my technical skills and tackle complex challenges with a logical and creative approach. Additionally, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, exploring different programming languages.
